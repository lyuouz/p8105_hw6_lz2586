## problem 1

### data cleaning and create variables

``` r
homicide <- read_csv('./data/homicide-data.csv') %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ', ')
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != 'Dallas, TX' & city_state != 'Phoenix, AZ' & city_state != 'Kansas City, MO' & city_state != 'Tulsa, AL') %>% 
  mutate(
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
    victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == 'White', 'white', 'non-white'),
    victim_race = as.factor(victim_race),
    victim_race = relevel(victim_race, ref = 'white'),
    victim_sex = fct_relevel(victim_sex, ref = 'Male')
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

    ## Warning in evalq(as.numeric(victim_age), <environment>): NAs introduced by
    ## coercion

  - Created new variables:
      - `city_state`: combines city and state  
      - `resolved`: 1 = resolved (‘Closed by arrest’), 0 = unresolved  
      - `race_cate`: race categorized as `white` and `non-white`, using
        `white` as the reference
  - Filtered cities with no race data

### Logistic model for Baltimore

A data frame for `Baltimore`

``` r
baltimore <- homicide %>% 
  filter(city == 'Baltimore')
```

logistic model for Baltimore

``` r
logistic_baltimore <- baltimore %>% 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = .,, family = binomial())
```

``` r
baltimore_results <- logistic_baltimore %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         conf_low = estimate - 1.96 * std.error,
         conf_high = estimate + 1.96 * std.error,
         OR_low = exp(conf_low),
         OR_high = exp(conf_high))

baltimore_results %>% 
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, OR_low, OR_high) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| term                  |     log\_OR |        OR |   OR\_low |  OR\_high |
